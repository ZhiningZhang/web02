<h2 id="what-is-the-federal-estate-tax">🇺🇸 What Is the <strong>Federal
Estate Tax</strong>?</h2>
<p>The <strong>federal estate tax</strong> is a tax <strong>imposed by
the U.S. government on the total value of a deceased person’s
estate</strong> — but <strong>only if that estate exceeds a certain
threshold</strong> (called the <strong>exemption</strong> or
<strong>exclusion amount</strong>).</p>
<p>It is paid <strong>before</strong> the estate’s assets are
distributed to heirs.</p>

<p>💡 Example: If someone dies in 2025 with an estate worth $15 million
and no planning:</p>
<ul>
<li>Taxable amount = $15M – $13.61M = <strong>$1.39M</strong></li>
<li>Tax owed ≈ 40% × $1.39M = <strong>$556,000</strong></li>

tax-free (with proper filing).</li>
