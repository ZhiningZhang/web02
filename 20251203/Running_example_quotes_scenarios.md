# 🛡️ **LIFE INSURANCE EXAMPLES**

I’ll give 3 sample profiles (Age 30, 40, and 50) and show what Term vs Whole Life typically costs.

---

## **Scenario 1: Age 30, Healthy, Non-Smoker**

**Goal:** Protect spouse/kids, replace income
**Coverage:** $500,000

### **A. TERM LIFE (20 years)**

* Premium: **~$20–25/month**
* If you die during the 20 years → beneficiaries get **$500,000 tax-free**
* If you outlive term → policy ends with no value

### **B. WHOLE LIFE (Permanent)**

* Premium: **~$250–300/month**
* Lifetime coverage
* After 20 years, cash value might be **~$40,000–60,000**
* Death benefit always paid

### Summary (Age 30)

# 💰 **ANNUITY EXAMPLE SCENARIOS**

Here are 3 realistic examples for retirement income and growth.

---

## **Scenario A: You invest $100,000 at age 60 (Fixed Indexed Annuity)**

**Goal:** Protect principal + moderate upside + income at age 65.

* $100k grows with index (S&P 500)
* Typical real result: grows to **~$125,000–140,000** over 5 years
* With income rider, lifetime income at age 65: **~$650–750/month** for life

**If you live 25 more years:**

* Total income received: **$195,000–225,000**
* Still continues no matter how long you live

**If you die early:**

* Remaining account value goes to beneficiaries

---

## **Scenario B: Immediate Annuity — Age 65 puts in $200,000**

Start income **next month**

Guaranteed lifetime income:

* **~$1,050–$1,200 per month**
* Never runs out
* Some options return remaining balance if you die early

This is like buying yourself a pension.

---

## **Scenario C: Variable Annuity — Age 55 invests $150,000**

Goal: Growth + income later.

Assumed market return: 5–7% long-term.

At age 65 account may grow to:

* **Conservative:** ~$240k
* **Moderate:** ~$290k
* **Strong market:** ~$330k+

If converted to lifetime income at 65:

* **$900–$1,200/month for life** (depends on rider)

---

## 🎯 **Scenario D: Safe Growth (Fixed Annuity, no risk)**

Age 55 deposits: **$100,000**

Fixed rate: **5%**

After 10 years:
Value = **$162,889** (tax-deferred)

You can:

* Withdraw it
* Convert to income
* Leave to heirs
