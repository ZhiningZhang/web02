# 🟩 **2. FIXED ANNUITY**

### **How it grows**

* Insurance company guarantees a fixed interest rate (ex: 4.5% guaranteed for 5 years)
* No connection to stock market
* Very safe

### **Risk**

* No market loss
* Risk only if insurer becomes insolvent (state guaranty limits protect some amount)

### **Fees**

* Usually ZERO annual fees
* You pay only if you withdraw early (“surrender charge”)

### **Pros**

* Safe and predictable
* Guaranteed return
* Good for pre-retirement or near retirement
* Good alternative to CDs / savings bonds

### **Cons**

* Lowest growth potential
* Rate doesn’t adjust with markets

### **Best For**

✔ Conservative investors
✔ People 55+ wanting stable growth
✔ Money that must *not lose value*

# 🟧 **3. FIXED INDEXED ANNUITY (FIA)**

### **How it grows**

* Returns are tied to an index (S&P 500, etc.)
* But:
  🔸 **Floor = 0% (you can’t lose due to market drop)**
  🔸 **Cap** (e.g., max 8%) or **participation rate** (e.g., 60% of index gain)

### **Risk**

* No downside market risk
* Moderate risk of lower-than-expected returns due to caps/crediting rules

### **Fees**

* Base product: Often **no annual fee**
* Optional income riders: 0.9–1.5%

### **Pros**

* Safety like fixed annuity
* More upside potential
* Good balance between growth and safety

### **Cons**

* Caps/participation limit gains
* More complex to understand
* Growth varies year-to-year

### **Best For**

✔ Moderate investors
✔ Want safety but also want stock-market-linked upside
✔ Want lifetime income riders

# 🟥 **4. VARIABLE ANNUITY (VA)**

### **How it grows**

* Invested in **subaccounts** (similar to mutual funds)
* Fully exposed to stock and bond markets
* Unlimited upside *and* downside

### **Risk**

* Highest risk
* Account value can drop significantly
* Market returns affect income riders too

### **Fees**

Typically 2–4% per year:

* Mortality & expense fees (M&E)
* Investment subaccount fees
* Rider fees (income guarantees, death benefits)

### **Pros**

* Genuine market exposure
* Could provide largest lifetime income *if markets perform well*

# 🟫 **6. Real-World Example (Simple)**

Suppose you invest **$100,000** for 10 years.

### **Fixed Annuity @ 5%**

→ Guaranteed
→ Final value ≈ **$162,889**

---

### **Fixed Indexed Annuity**

* Floor = 0%
* Cap = 8%
* Market returns: 10%, -5%, 6%, 12%, 3%, 15%, -10%, 8%, 4%, 14%

After caps/floors, your credited returns might be:
**8%, 0%, 6%, 8%, 3%, 8%, 0%, 8%, 4%, 8%**

Final value ≈ **$204,000**

---

### **Variable Annity (Market returns same as above)**

Returns = **10%, -5%, 6%, 12%, 3%, 15%, -10%, 8%, 4%, 14%**
Minus 3% annual fees

Final value ≈ **$190,000** (could be more or less)

# 🟨 **7. Summary in One Sentence**

* **Fixed** = safe + predictable
* **Indexed** = safe + some upside
* **Variable** = market growth + high risk + high fees
