# 🛡️ **1. TERM LIFE INSURANCE**

### **What it is**

* Pure insurance.
* Covers you for a chosen term (10, 20, 30 years).
* If you die during the term → beneficiaries get payout.
* If you outlive it → the policy ends, no cash value.

### **Cost**

* **Cheapest** option.
* Example: A healthy 40-year-old might pay **$20–40/month** for $500k coverage.

### **Pros**

✔ Inexpensive
✔ Simple
✔ Best for income protection
✔ Perfect for temporary needs (kids, mortgage)

### **Cons**

✘ No cash value
✘ Coverage ends
✘ Can get expensive to renew later in life

### **Best for**

* Families with young kids
* Mortgage protection
* People who want high coverage at a low cost

# 🟡 **2. WHOLE LIFE INSURANCE (WL)**

### **What it is**

* Permanent coverage (never expires).
* Guaranteed cash value growth.
* Some companies pay dividends (depending on performance).

### **What grows**

* Cash value grows **at a guaranteed rate** (e.g., 2–5%) plus possible dividends.

### **Cost**

* **Most expensive** form of life insurance.
* Often **10–20x the cost of term life**.

Example: A healthy 40-year-old may pay **$400–700/month** for $500k WL.

### **Pros**

✔ Guaranteed cash value
✔ Lifetime coverage
✔ Tax-deferred growth
✔ Can borrow against cash value
✔ Good for estate planning
✔ Dividends (if participating)

### **Cons**

✘ High premiums
✘ Low ROI compared to stock market
✘ Long commitment required
✘ Less flexible

### **Best for**

# 🔵 **3. INDEXED UNIVERSAL LIFE (IUL)**

### **What it is**

* Permanent life insurance with flexible premiums.
* Cash value grows based on index (usually **S&P 500**).
* Protected from losses (floor = 0%).
* Gains are capped (e.g., 8–12%).

### **How growth works**

If S&P 500 goes:

* +12% → credited maybe +10% (cap)
* +4% → credited +4%
* –20% → credited 0% (floor, no loss)

### **Cost**

* Cheaper than whole life
* More expensive than term

A 40-year-old could pay **$200–350/month** for meaningful cash growth.

### **Pros**

✔ Growth linked to S&P 500 (can be higher than WL)
✔ No loss in bad markets
✔ Tax-free loans
✔ Flexible premiums and benefits
✔ Good for tax-advantaged retirement income

### **Cons**

✘ More complex
✘ Caps limit growth
✘ Requires long-term funding (10+ years)
✘ Risk of policy lapse if underfunded

### **Best for**

* People who want tax-free retirement income strategies
* Moderate risk tolerance
* Want flexibility vs whole life
* Business owners, high-income earners
