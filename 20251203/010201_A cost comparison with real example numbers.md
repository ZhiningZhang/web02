Good idea — here are **realistic cost-comparison examples** (with numbers) for **Term Life**, **Whole Life**, and — where approximate — **Indexed Universal Life (IUL)**. I use typical U.S. rates (nonsmoker, average health) with round assumptions (e.g. $500,000 coverage) to make it concrete.

## 📊 Typical Costs: Term vs Whole vs IUL

Based on recent publicly available data for a healthy nonsmoker buying a $500,000 policy (common benchmark). ([NerdWallet][1])

| Age (when buying) | Policy Type & Coverage                                          | Approx. Monthly / Annual Premium*                                                                        |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Age 40**        | 20-year Term, $500,000                                          | about **$55/month** (≈ $660/yr) ([NerdWallet][1])                                                        |
| **Age 40**        | Whole Life, $500,000                                            | about **$667/month** (≈ $8,000/yr) ([MoneyGeek.com][2])                                                  |
| **Age 40**        | Universal Life (similar to IUL in being permanent / cash-value) | ~ **$294/month** (≈ $3,500/yr) — though this varies a lot by company and structure. ([MoneyGeek.com][3]) |

* “Universal Life” here is a rough proxy; true IUL pricing depends heavily on indexing assumptions, caps, and policy design.

Because of the big cost differences, this table is often used by advisers to illustrate trade-offs.

## 🧾 What This Means Over Long-Term (20 Years Example)

Suppose you buy at 40 and keep paying premiums for 20 years (until age 60) — costs accumulate significantly, especially for permanent policies.

* **Term Life (20-year term):**
   Premiums ≈ $55/month → over 20 years, total ≈ **$13,200**. Coverage ends after 20 years; no cash value at end.

* **Whole Life:**
   Premiums ≈ $667/month → over 20 years, total ≈ **$160,000**. In theory you get lifetime coverage + cash value buildup (though how much depends on policy dividend/interest and fees).

* **Permanent (UL / IUL-style):**
   Premiums ≈ $294/month → over 20 years, total ≈ **$70,600**. Coverage remains, and there’s potential cash value accumulation — but results vary based on interest/index returns, fees, and how the policy is funded.

Some agents (or websites) show hypothetical 20-year outcomes like: Term covers death benefit cheaply, Whole/IUL policies build perhaps **$25,000–$40,000+ in cash value** after 20 years (depending on performance) while keeping death benefit active. ([Local Life Agents][4])

## ✅ What the Cost Differences Tell You

* **Term life = low cost, max coverage for minimal money.** Best when you primarily need protection (income replacement, mortgage, dependents) for a limited period.
* **Whole life = high cost, permanent coverage, guaranteed cash value growth (but expensive).** Good if you need lifetime protection + want cash value accumulation + aren’t shopping for lowest cost.
* **IUL / Universal (permanent) = middle-ground cost, potential for growth, flexible.** You pay more than term but much less than whole — with the chance that cash value grows if the underlying index performs — but there’s more uncertainty.

## ⚠️ Caveats & What to Watch Out For

* These numbers assume **healthy, nonsmoking** individuals — costs rise significantly if you have health issues or smoke. ([NerdWallet][1])
* Permanent policies’ cash-value growth is **not guaranteed** — actual return depends on company performance, fees, and how you fund the policy (especially for IUL).
* Many “average” quotes use preferred health classes; “standard” or “substandard” will cost more.
* For term life: if your term ends and you still need coverage, renewing is usually much more expensive than starting younger.

If you like — I can **build 5–10 example scenarios** (ages: 30, 40, 50; coverage: $250k, $500k, $1M; policy type: Term/Whole/IUL) so you can see how cost scales by age, coverage, and policy type.
Do you want me to build that table for you now?
