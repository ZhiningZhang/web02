Good — here's a **set of example scenarios** with approximate costs for different ages, coverage amounts, and policy types. Because rates vary by insurer, health, gender, etc., treat them as rough estimates for a **healthy nonsmoker** purchasing a **level term or permanent policy** in the U.S.

I use published data from recent sources for term life and whole/universal-life as proxies for IUL. ([NerdWallet][1])

## 🔢 Example Scenario Table — Estimated Annual Premiums

| Age    | Coverage       | Policy Type                        | Estimated Annual Premium / Monthly Premium (where available)           |
| ------ | -------------- | ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **30** | **$250,000**   | 20-year Term                       | ≈ **$162/yr** ([Forbes][2])                                            |
| **30** | **$500,000**   | 20-year Term                       | ≈ **$250 – $260/yr** ([Forbes][2])                                     |
| **30** | **$1,000,000** | 20-year Term                       | ≈ **$260 – $325/yr** (very approximate — scales roughly) ([Forbes][2]) |
| **40** | **$250,000**   | 20-year Term                       | ≈ **$227/yr** (≈ $19/month) ([Forbes][2])                              |
| **40** | **$500,000**   | 20-year Term                       | ≈ **$365/yr** ([Forbes][2])                                            |
| **40** | **$1,000,000** | 20-year Term                       | ≈ **$650 – $640/yr** (scale-up) ([Forbes][2])                          |
| **50** | **$250,000**   | 20-year Term                       | ≈ **$485/yr** (≈ $40/month) ([Forbes][2])                              |
| **50** | **$500,000**   | 20-year Term                       | ≈ **$880 – $900/yr** ([Forbes][2])                                     |
| **50** | **$1,000,000** | 20-year Term                       | ≈ **$1,600 – $1,700/yr** ([Forbes][2])                                 |
| **30** | **$500,000**   | Permanent (Whole / Universal-type) | ≈ **$3,700 – $4,100/yr** (~ $300–$340/month) ([NerdWallet][1])         |
| **40** | **$500,000**   | Permanent (Whole / Universal-type) | ≈ **$5,850 – $6,000/yr** (~ $490–$500/month) ([NerdWallet][1])         |
| **50** | **$500,000**   | Permanent (Whole / Universal-type) | ≈ **$8,700 – $9,000/yr** (~ $730–$750/month) ([NerdWallet][1])         |

## 💡 What These Illustrations Show

* **Term life** remains very affordable when you're younger — especially for moderate coverage. Example: at age 30, $250,000 coverage costs about ~$162/yr for a 20-year term.
* As you get older, term premiums rise — at age 50, that same $250,000 costs ~$485/yr.
* **Permanent policies** (whole/universal-type used as proxy for an IUL / cash-value policy) are **much more expensive**: e.g. a 40-year-old for $500,000 might pay ~$5,800–6,000/yr — far higher than term premiums.
* The **cost gap** between term and permanent widens with both coverage amount and permanence/lifetime coverage, which is why some people opt for a smaller death benefit or a term + invest-the-difference approach.

## ⚠️ Why These Are Rough Estimates (Not Guarantees)

* **Health, gender, smoking status, lifestyle** — real costs vary a lot depending on your health and risk factors. The data above assumes a “healthy nonsmoker.” ([NerdWallet][1])
* **Policy structure & insurer** — especially for permanent (IUL/UL/Whole) policies: cash-value growth, fees, indexing strategy, and policy funding affect real cost and benefit.
* **Coverage duration matters** — these are for 20-year term or permanent policies; term premiums assume you only need coverage for the term length.
* **Rates evolve over time** — life insurance premiums and interest/market conditions change, so past averages may shift over time.

If you like, I can build a **spreadsheet-like file** (CSV or table) with **10–20 combinations** of age / coverage / policy type / premium — you could plug in your own details and even adjust for spouse, children, inflation, etc.
Do you want me to build that file for you now (and maybe email-ready)?
