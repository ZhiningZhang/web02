<html><body><p>In U.S. tax law, a <strong>U.S. tax resident</strong> is someone the
IRS treats as a resident for tax purposes. That means they‚Äôre generally
taxed on their <em>worldwide income</em>, not just U.S. income.</p>
<p>A person can be a U.S. tax resident under <strong>three main
categories</strong>:</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="u.s.-citizens"><strong>1. U.S. Citizens</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>All U.S. citizens are considered tax residents, no matter where they
live.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="u.s.-lawful-permanent-residents-green-card-test"><strong>2. U.S.
Lawful Permanent Residents (‚ÄúGreen Card‚Äù Test)</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>If you have a <strong>green card</strong> at any time during the
calendar year, you are a U.S. tax resident for that year (unless you
qualify for certain treaty exceptions or formally surrender the green
card).</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="substantial-presence-test-spt"><strong>3. Substantial Presence
Test (SPT)</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><p>If you are <strong>not</strong> a U.S. citizen or green card
holder, you may still be a tax resident if you spend enough time in the
U.S.</p></li>
<li><p>Formula:</p>
<pre><code>Days in Current Year   +  (1/3 √ó Days in Previous Year)  +  (1/6 √ó Days in Two Years Ago)  ‚â• 183</code></pre></li>
<li><p>You must also be physically present in the U.S. for <strong>at
least 31 days in the current year</strong>.</p></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="exceptions-even-if-you-meet-spt"><strong>Exceptions (Even If You
Meet SPT)</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Closer connection to another country</strong> and present in
the U.S. fewer than 183 days this year.</li>
<li><strong>Exempt individuals</strong> (certain students, teachers,
diplomats, professional athletes on specific visas).</li>
<li>Certain <strong>tax treaty tie-breaker rules</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>üí° <strong>Key point:</strong> Being a U.S. tax resident is different
from being an immigration resident. Even without a green card, enough
time in the U.S. can make you a tax resident.</p>
<hr />
<p>If you want, I can make you a <strong>visual decision
flowchart</strong> showing exactly how to determine U.S. tax residency
in seconds. Would you like me to do that?</p>
