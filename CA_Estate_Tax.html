<html><body><p>Great question! Here’s a clear explanation of the <strong>California
estate tax</strong>:</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="does-california-have-an-estate-tax">🟢 <strong>Does California
Have an Estate Tax?</strong></h2>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>No — California does not currently have an estate tax or
inheritance tax.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So if someone dies while a California resident, <strong>only federal
estate tax</strong> may apply — and <strong>only if the estate is large
enough</strong> (over ~$13.61 million in 2025).</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="historical-note">📜 Historical Note</h2>
<ul>
<li>California <strong>used to have an estate tax</strong> (called a
<strong>“pick-up tax”</strong>), but it was repealed in 2005.</li>
<li>It ended because the federal government eliminated the state estate
tax credit that supported it.</li>
<li>As of now, there is <strong>no separate California estate tax
law</strong>.</li>
