<ul>
<li><strong>Who pays it:</strong> The <strong>giver (donor)</strong>
usually pays the tax, <strong>not</strong> the person receiving the
gift.</li>
<li><strong>Why it exists:</strong> To stop people from avoiding
<strong>estate tax</strong> by giving away their wealth before they
die.</li>
<li><strong>When it applies:</strong> Only if your gift is worth more
than the <strong>annual exclusion amount</strong> or if you exceed your
<strong>lifetime exemption</strong>.</li>
