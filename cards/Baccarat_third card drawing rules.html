<li>If either Player or Banker has a total of <strong>8 or 9</strong>
with their first two cards, <strong>no more cards are drawn</strong> and
the hand ends.</li>

<ul>
<li>If Player’s total is <strong>0–5</strong>, Player <strong>draws a
third card</strong>.</li>

<h3 id="step-3-bankers-third-card-rule">Step 3: Banker’s Third Card

<li>If Player <strong>did not draw</strong> a third card, then Banker
draws a third card if Banker’s total is <strong>0–5</strong>, otherwise
stands.</li>

<h3 id="what-does-this-mean">What does this mean?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Banker’s decision is more complex because it depends on Player’s
third card value.</li>
<li>The Banker follows these rules to maximize the chances to get closer
to 9.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="example">Example</h3>
<ul>
<li>Player’s first two cards total <strong>5</strong> → Player draws a
third card (say, 4).</li>
<li>Banker’s first two cards total <strong>4</strong> → Banker looks at
Player’s third card (4). Since Banker total is 4 and Player’s third card
is between 2–7, Banker <strong>draws a third card</strong>.</li>
