<html><body><p>The <strong>estate tax</strong> and <strong>gift tax</strong> are
really two parts of the <strong>same U.S. federal tax system</strong> —
they work together under what’s called the <strong>Unified Gift and
Estate Tax</strong>. The idea is simple:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The IRS wants to tax large transfers of wealth, whether you give them
away while alive (<strong>gift tax</strong>) or after you die
(<strong>estate tax</strong>).</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Shared Lifetime Exemption</strong>: There is <strong>one
combined limit</strong> for both taxes. In 2025, it’s <strong>$13.61
million</strong> per person.</p>
<ul>
<li>Gifts you make during your lifetime above the <strong>annual
exclusion</strong> reduce this lifetime limit.</li>
<li>Whatever is left of the limit applies to your estate when you
die.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Annual Exclusion First</strong>: You can give <strong>up
to $18,000 per person per year</strong> (2025) without affecting your
lifetime limit.</p></li>

<h3 id="while-alive-gift-tax"><strong>1️⃣ While Alive – Gift
Tax</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>You give your daughter <strong>$100,000</strong> in 2025.</li>
<li>$18,000 is excluded (annual exclusion).</li>
<li>The remaining <strong>$82,000</strong> counts toward your
<strong>lifetime exemption</strong>.</li>
<li>You file a <strong>gift tax return (Form 709)</strong>, but you pay
<strong>no tax</strong> unless your lifetime total exceeds $13.61M.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="after-death-estate-tax"><strong>2️⃣ After Death – Estate
Tax</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>When you die, your estate is valued at <strong>$12
million</strong>.</li>
<li>But you already used <strong>$2 million</strong> of your lifetime
exemption on past gifts.</li>
<li>That leaves <strong>$11.61 million</strong> exempt.</li>
<li>The excess ($12M – $11.61M = $0.39M) is subject to <strong>estate
tax</strong> (up to 40%).</li>

<h2 id="important-points">⚠️ Important Points</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>No “double tax”</strong> — the same amount isn’t taxed
twice; gifts just reduce the estate exemption.</li>
<li><strong>Spousal Transfers</strong> — generally unlimited if your
spouse is a U.S. citizen.</li>
<li><strong>Charitable Transfers</strong> — exempt from both taxes.</li>
<li><strong>State Taxes</strong> — some states have their own separate
estate or inheritance taxes with much lower exemptions.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you want, I can draw you a <strong>visual flowchart</strong>
showing how lifetime gifts and estate value combine under the unified
system — it makes the concept much easier to remember.</p>
