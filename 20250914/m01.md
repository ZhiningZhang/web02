I reviewed your file, and here’s a detailed breakdown of what it contains and what it means:

---

## 1. **Policy Overview**

* **Type**: Pacific Horizon IUL 2 (Indexed Universal Life Insurance, Flexible Premium, Adjustable)
* **Insured**: Female, age 40, preferred non-tobacco class
* **Death Benefit Option**: A (Level Death Benefit)
* **Total Face Amount**: \$20,000,000
* **Premium**: \$350,000 annually for 10 years, then \$0 thereafter
* **Design Option Selected**: Long-Term Performance (designed to maximize accumulated value later in life, not in early years)

---

## 2. **Premiums and Coverage**

* Premiums are scheduled at **\$350,000 per year for 10 years** (10-pay).
* The policy includes **Basic Coverage (\$15M)** plus **Annual Renewable Term Rider coverage (\$5M)**, together totaling \$20M.
* After year 10, no further premiums are illustrated, but coverage continues as long as values are sufficient.

---

## 3. **Interest Crediting**

* The policy offers multiple **indexed accounts** tied to the S\&P 500, Nasdaq (Invesco QQQ), and BlackRock Endura Index, with varying caps, participation rates, and terms.
* Example:

  * 1-Year Indexed S\&P 500 account with a 10% growth cap and 100% participation.
  * 2-Year and 5-Year accounts allow compounding over longer horizons.
* There is also a **Fixed Account** with a **guaranteed minimum 1% interest** and current declared rate of 4.5%.
* The illustrated rate for the main 1-Year Indexed Account is **6.33%**.

---

## 4. **Riders Included**

* **Enhanced Performance Factor Rider (EPFR)** – optional, but Classic (no added cost or benefit) is illustrated here.
* **Premier Living Benefits Rider** – allows accelerated benefits in case of chronic or terminal illness.
* **Interest Guarantee on Termination Rider** – provides a minimum alternate accumulated value if policy lapses.
* **Conversion Rider** – allows conversion to another cash value life policy during year 8.
* **Age 90 No-Lapse Guarantee Rider** – guarantees the death benefit to age 90 if minimum premiums are maintained.

---

## 5. **Tax Information**

* The illustration assumes the policy **qualifies under IRS Section 7702 (Cash Value Accumulation Test)** so it remains tax-advantaged.
* Policy distributions (withdrawals, loans) may be tax-free if properly structured, but could create taxable events if not managed carefully.
* There is mention of **Modified Endowment Contract (MEC) rules**, meaning if overfunded incorrectly, the policy loses some tax benefits.

---

## 6. **Key Warnings**

* This is **only an illustration**; actual performance will differ depending on index returns, caps, participation rates, and policy charges.
* Values are **not guaranteed** except those explicitly labeled (like minimum interest rates).
* Paying less than illustrated or poor index performance could cause the policy to lapse, especially in early years.

✅ **In short**:
This file illustrates a Pacific Life Indexed Universal Life Insurance policy for a 40-year-old female. It shows paying \$350K per year for 10 years to fund a **\$20M death benefit**. The design is focused on long-term performance and cash accumulation, using market index-linked accounts with floors (to protect against losses) and caps (limiting upside). Multiple riders are included for guarantees and living benefits.

Would you like me to also pull out the **numeric projections** (cash values, death benefit, loan/withdrawal options) year by year from the illustration? That’s often the most practical part for seeing how the policy is expected to perform over time.
