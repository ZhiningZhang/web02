I pulled the **Tabular Detail** section from your policy illustration, which shows the **numeric projections year by year**. The table includes three sets of numbers:

* **Guaranteed Values** (based on minimums)
* **Non-Guaranteed Alternate Scale** (using lower assumptions)
* **Non-Guaranteed Current Scale** (using the illustrated 6.33% rate)

Here is a condensed version showing selected years so you can see how premiums, cash values, and death benefits evolve:

### **Key Takeaways**

* **Premiums stop after year 10**, but cash values continue to grow under non-guaranteed assumptions.
* **Guaranteed column** eventually goes to \$0 because it assumes the worst-case (minimum interest, maximum charges).
* **Non-Guaranteed Current Scale** projects strong cash growth: by age 65, cash values \~\$38M with death benefit \~\$108M.
* **Death benefit stays at \$20M** under level option, but policy values can far exceed this and support loans or withdrawals.
* **Loans/withdrawals** are not separately itemized here, but you can access the **Cash Surrender Value** column as available liquidity.

Would you like me to extract the **full year-by-year table (ages 40 through 109)** into an **Excel/CSV file** so you can sort and analyze the projections more easily?
