Great question 👍 — let’s dive deep into **“非保证当前 (Non-Guaranteed Current Scale)”** in the context of life insurance (especially **Indexed Universal Life, IUL** and **Universal Life, UL**).

---

## 📌 Definition

* **Non-Guaranteed Current Scale** = the set of **assumptions currently used by the insurance company** (interest crediting rate, index cap, participation rate, policy charges, etc.) to project the policy’s performance.
* It is **“non-guaranteed”** because the company can change these assumptions in the future, as long as they stay within contractual maximums or minimums.
* Often presented in **illustrations** (policy projections) to show how the policy might grow under today’s conditions.

---

## ⚖️ Key Points

1. **Based on current company practice**

   * Example: Today the insurer may credit **5% interest** to the fixed account, or set the **index cap at 10%**.

2. **Not guaranteed for the future**

   * Next year, the same company could lower the credited rate to **4%**, or reduce the index cap to **8%**, depending on market conditions.

3. **Still within contractual limits**

   * The contract usually specifies a **minimum guaranteed crediting rate** (e.g., 0% floor in an IUL), and a **maximum cost of insurance charge**.
   * As long as changes stay within these limits, the company can adjust them.

## 📊 Example Scenarios

### Example 1: Fixed Account in UL

* **Today’s Non-Guaranteed Current Scale**: Insurer credits **4.5% interest** on the fixed account.
* **Guaranteed Minimum**: 2%.
* If interest rates in the economy decline, the insurer may reduce the credited rate to **3.5%** next year.
* Policyholder sees lower cash value growth, even though the policy remains in force.

### Example 2: Indexed Universal Life (IUL)

* **Today’s Non-Guaranteed Current Scale**:

  * Participation Rate = 100%
  * Growth Cap = 11%
  * Floor Rate = 0%
* **Guaranteed Minimums**:

  * Floor Rate = 0%
  * Cap could legally drop as low as 3% (depending on contract).
* If the insurer lowers the cap to **8%** in the future, your potential growth is reduced, even though your initial illustration showed higher values.

### Example 3: Policy Charges

* **Current Scale**: Monthly insurance charges (COI) are **\$2.50 per \$1,000** of net amount at risk.
* **Guaranteed Maximum**: \$5.00 per \$1,000.
* If company expenses increase, they may raise charges to \$3.50, still below the contractual max.

## ✅ Why It Matters

* **Illustrations** often show **Non-Guaranteed Current Scale projections** — these look attractive but are only valid if current assumptions stay constant.
* Real performance may be lower (or occasionally higher if the company improves rates).
* When evaluating policies, always compare:

  * **Guaranteed values** (worst case, very conservative)
  * **Non-Guaranteed Current values** (best estimate under current conditions)

👉 In short:
**非保证当前 (Non-Guaranteed Current Scale)** shows you what your policy could look like if today’s interest rates, index caps, and charges never change. It’s a **useful planning tool** but not a promise — always check the guaranteed side as a safety net.

Would you like me to also explain the difference between **非保证当前 (Non-Guaranteed Current Scale)** and **非保证替代 (Non-Guaranteed Alternate Scale)**, since they often appear together in policy illustrations?
