<html><body><p>The <strong>donation deduction</strong> (in U.S. tax law, usually
called the <strong>charitable contribution deduction</strong>) is a tax
benefit you can claim when you give <strong>money, property, or other
assets</strong> to a <strong>qualified charitable
organization</strong>.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="how-it-works">üìå How It Works</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Purpose:</strong> To encourage charitable giving by lowering
your <strong>taxable income</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Who can claim it:</strong> Individuals and businesses that
<strong>itemize deductions</strong> on their tax returns.</li>
<li><strong>Effect:</strong> The value of your donation is subtracted
from your taxable income, which can reduce the tax you owe.</li>
</ul>

<hr />
<h2 id="examples">üìù Examples</h2>
<ul>
<li>Donate <strong>$1,000 cash</strong> to a 501(c)(3) charity ‚Üí Deduct
$1,000 from taxable income.</li>
<li>Donate <strong>stock worth $5,000</strong> you bought for $2,000 ‚Üí
Deduct full $5,000, and avoid paying capital gains tax on the $3,000
gain.</li>
<li>Give $200 to a friend in need ‚Üí <strong>Not deductible</strong>,
because it‚Äôs not to a qualified charity.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>If you want, I can also explain <strong>how to combine charitable
donations with tax strategies</strong> (like donating appreciated stock)
so you can give more while paying less tax. That‚Äôs where the biggest
savings come in.</p>
