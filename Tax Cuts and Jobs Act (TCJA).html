<h2 id="summary">💬 Summary:</h2>
<p>The <strong>TCJA</strong> was the biggest overhaul of the U.S. tax
code in over 30 years. It <strong>lowered taxes</strong> for most
taxpayers and <strong>cut corporate rates</strong> to encourage
investment and repatriation of profits. However, it also
<strong>increased the federal deficit</strong>, and many individual tax
benefits are scheduled to <strong>end in 2025</strong> unless
renewed.</p>

taxes.</p>
