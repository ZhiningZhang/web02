ðŸ’¡ **Tip:**
If you want **completely free** and **Excel-based** for your 50 houses, the best starting points are:

* **Stessaâ€™s rent roll & expense tracker (Excel)**
* **AssetAFC Tracker**
* **Zillow Worksheet** (if you want very simple tracking)

---

If you want, I can prepare a **custom Excel file** for you with:

* Tabs for each property or one consolidated ledger
* Automatic rent due & overdue highlighting
* Monthly and yearly income/expense summaries
* Utility & fee tracking

That way you get something as good as the paid templatesâ€”still free.
