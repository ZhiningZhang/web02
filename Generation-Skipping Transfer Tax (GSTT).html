<html><body><p>The <strong>intergenerational gift tax</strong> you’re referring to
is formally called the <strong>Generation-Skipping Transfer Tax
(GSTT)</strong> in U.S. tax law.</p>
<p>It’s essentially an <em>extra layer of tax</em> designed to prevent
wealthy individuals from avoiding estate and gift taxes by transferring
assets <strong>directly to grandchildren (or younger
generations)</strong> instead of their own children.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="why-it-exists">📌 Why It Exists</h2>
<p>Without this tax, a very wealthy person could:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Leave everything to their children → taxed once by estate tax.</li>
<li>Children then leave it to grandchildren → taxed again.</li>
</ol>
<p>To avoid <strong>two rounds of tax</strong>, they could skip the
children entirely and give directly to the grandchildren — avoiding one
round. The <strong>GSTT</strong> closes that loophole.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="how-it-works">🔍 How It Works</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Applies to</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gifts or bequests to someone <strong>two or more generations
younger</strong> than you (grandchildren, great-grandchildren,
etc.).</li>
<li>Also applies if you give to an unrelated person more than
<strong>37½ years younger</strong> than you.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Tax Rate</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Flat <strong>40%</strong> (same as the top estate/gift tax
rate).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Exemption</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>There’s a <strong>separate lifetime GSTT exemption</strong> — in
2025, it’s <strong>$13.61 million</strong>, the same amount as the
gift/estate exemption.</li>
<li>Annual gift tax exclusion ($18,000 in 2025) still applies.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2 id="example">📝 Example</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>You give your granddaughter <strong>$1 million</strong> in
2025.</p></li>
<li><p>$18,000 is excluded (annual gift exclusion).</p></li>
<li><p>The remaining <strong>$982,000</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Counts against your <strong>lifetime gift/estate exemption</strong>
<em>and</em></li>
<li>Counts against your <strong>GSTT exemption</strong>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>If your GSTT exemption is used up, the remaining amount is taxed
at <strong>40%</strong> in addition to any gift/estate tax.</p></li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h2 id="key-points-to-remember">🧠 Key Points to Remember</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>It’s not a separate “gift tax”</strong> for ordinary gifts —
it’s an <em>additional tax</em> that only applies when you skip a
generation.</li>
<li><strong>GSTT, gift tax, and estate tax</strong> can all interact in
one transfer.</li>
<li>Careful estate planning (like using trusts) is often needed to avoid
accidentally triggering GSTT.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>If you want, I can give you a <strong>simple chart showing how gift
tax, estate tax, and GSTT layer together</strong> — it makes this much
easier to visualize.</p>
